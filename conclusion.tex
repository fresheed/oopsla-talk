  {\large Summary:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We describe fairness for operational memory models
  \item And provide an equivalent uniform declarative definition
  \item Which is used to prove lock algorithms termination.
  \end{itemize}

  \todo{{\large More in the paper: ?}}

  {\large Further work -- support more models:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Richer memory accesses (like in RC11)
  \item Additional fairness conditions (needed for ARMv8)
  \end{itemize}
